### Stage 0 Project: Getting Started with HTML Notes
- Create an HTML file to contain your notes from this section
- Submit your notes as an HTML file using the tags you learned about in these lessons
- Keep it simple. CSS is used for styling and is not necessary for this project
- Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code

### Stage 1 Project: 
- Create a personal web page showing off all the skills you've learned so far. Can be on any topic
- Use HTML tags like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to structure your page
- Style your page using CSS class selectors
- Add images to your page by referencing local files on your computer or online files via a URL
<b><i> Code review criteria: </i></b>  
- HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"> HTML validation </a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input"> CSS validation </a> tests
- Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;). 
- All tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a &lt;p&gt; tag to make a headline)
