### Stage 0 Project: Getting Started with HTML Notes
- Create an HTML file to contain your notes from this section
- Submit your notes as an HTML file using the tags you learned about in these lessons
- Keep it simple. CSS is used for styling and is not necessary for this project
- Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code

### Stage 1 Project: 
<ul>
  <li> Create a personal web page showing off all the skills you've learned so far. Can be on any topic </li>
  <li> Use HTML tags like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to structure your page </li>
  <li> Style your page using CSS class selectors </li>
  <li> Add images to your page by referencing local files on your computer or online files via a URL </li>
</ul>
<i> Code review criteria:
<ul>
  <li> Use of Syntax: HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass 
       <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"> HTML validation </a> and 
       <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input"> CSS validation </a> tests </li>
  <li> Use of Logical HTML Structure: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element 
           (like a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;) </li>
      <li> All tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a &lt;p&gt; tag to make a headline) </li>
    </ul>
  <li> Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling: </li>
    <ul> 
      <li> There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code </li> 
      <li> Similar HTML elements should have the same class name </li>
      <li> Must include a CSS file in your project submission. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using &lt;style&gt; tags is not sufficient Â </li>
    </ul>
  <li> Use of Tags: Page uses tags correctly, e.g., &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;h1&gt; for main heading, and so on </li>
  <li> Content Display: Page displays at least one image and some text </li>
</ul>
